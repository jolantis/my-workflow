# CSS Style Guide

* Two spaces indentation.
* Use lowercase hex colors (e.g. #fff) instead of color names (e.g. white).
* Use * {box-sizing: border-box;}.
* Use hyphens between class names, not camelCase or under_scores.
* Use only classes for styling most of the time (no #ids, elems etc).
* Don't use inline styling.
* Profile your selectors with webkit inspector.
