# My beatufiul Workflow

A developer can't survive without a organized workflow. I believe that all developers should have a documentation with your processes. All days I'm changing and optimizing my workflow, I think I'm a little neurotic with this.

For keep my workflow organized and centralized, I created this repository. In here contains all files, documentations, utilities, applications and others things that I need to keep a beauty and organized workflow.

## What's included here?

#### [How do I setup my OSX](setup-osx.md)
#### [My application list](apps.md)
#### [My dotfiles](/dotfiles)
#### [Coding Style](/coding-style)
#### [Photoshop extensions that I use]()
#### [A list of extensions for Chrome]()
